1. **Input**:
   - You have `n` kids, each with a certain number of candies.
   - This information is stored in an integer array `candies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies that the `i`-th kid has.
   - You also have an integer `extraCandies`, which represents some additional candies you can give to any of the kids.

2. **Objective**:
   - For each kid, imagine giving them *all* of the `extraCandies` (temporarily ignoring the other kids).
   - After giving a particular kid the `extraCandies`, check if they would have the **most candies** out of all the kids. 
   - You need to find out if each kid could potentially have the highest candy count if they were given all the `extraCandies`.
    
   Example:
      candies = [2, 3, 5, 1, 3]
      extraCandies = 3

   - **Step 1**: Find the current maximum candy count. Here, the maximum is `5` (from the third kid).
   - **Step 2**: For each kid, check if their candy count plus `extraCandies` reaches or exceeds `5`.

     - Kid 0: `2 + 3 = 5` (which equals the max of `5`), so `result[0] = true`.
     - Kid 1: `3 + 3 = 6` (which is greater than `5`), so `result[1] = true`.
     - Kid 2: `5 + 3 = 8` (which is greater than `5`), so `result[2] = true`.
     - Kid 3: `1 + 3 = 4` (which is less than `5`), so `result[3] = false`.
     - Kid 4: `3 + 3 = 6` (which is greater than `5`), so `result[4] = true`.

   - **Final Output**: `[true, true, true, false, true]`
